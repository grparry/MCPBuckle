## Attribution

MCPBuckle is inspired by and uses similar patterns to [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore), which is licensed under the MIT License.

The following components of MCPBuckle were inspired by Swashbuckle:

1. **Controller Discovery Pattern**: The approach to discovering controllers and actions using `IActionDescriptorCollectionProvider` is similar to Swashbuckle's discovery mechanism.

2. **XML Documentation Parsing**: The XML documentation parsing logic is inspired by Swashbuckle's approach to extracting documentation from XML files.

3. **Extension Methods Pattern**: The pattern for registering services and middleware via extension methods follows Swashbuckle's approach to ASP.NET Core integration.

4. **Type Mapping**: The mapping of .NET types to JSON Schema types is inspired by Swashbuckle's type mapping logic.
